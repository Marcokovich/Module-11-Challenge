# Module-9-Challenge-UFOs
## 1. Project Overview
### Background:
After finishing a table with a dynamic table that enabled search functionality, we've been tasked with going above and beyond in terms of search functionality. We are to make the script and website capable of doing a search using date and other features such as shape, city, state, or country.
### Purpose:
The purpose of this code is to create a website using .html file that is stylized by a .css file. A .js file is then used to create a dynamic table with search functionality on the html file. The table is update and filter through the searches based on what is inputted into the different search bars.
## 2. Results
### How to use the search function:
- To search for anything insert what detail you are looking for into the respective search bar.

- For state, the abbreviated state is to be inserted i.e., CA for California.
- For country, the abbreviated country code should be inserted i.e., US for United States.
- Date should be formatted to be the same as the placeholder text as it would not work.
- Pressing 'enter' or 'tab' on the keyboard will refresh the table to be filtered by the query you put in.
- The image below is an example of each search bar being used.

note: case sensitivity does not matter for the search.

## 3. Summary:
### Drawbacks of New Site:
- Incomplete text does not work for the search, so if you wanted to search of sightings in a specific month, you would not be able too. In addition to this, if you wanted to search for states or cities that started with the letter "A". You couldn't.
### Recommendations for Further Development:
- Incorporating the fix to the drawback to allow for searches to be incomplete to look for broader search spreads.
- Incorporating a search that isn't case sensitive (however, as you may have noticed I went ahead and did this myself for my own convenience).
- Incorporating a saved list to display multiple cities, states, or shapes. i.e. if you wanted to see all sightings on the east coast you can put all of the east coast states.
