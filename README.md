## 1. Project Overview
### Background:
### Purpose:
## 2. Results
### How to use the search function:
- To search for anything insert what detail you are looking for into the respective search bar.
- For state, the abbreviated state is to be inserted i.e. CA for California.
- For country, the abbreviated country code should be inserted i.e. US for United States.
- Date should be formatted to be the same as the placeholder text as it would not work.
- Pressing 'enter' or 'tab' on the keyboard will refresh the table to be filtered by the query you put in.
- The image below is an example of each search bar being used.

note: case sensitivity does not matter for the search.

## 3. Summary:
### Drawbacks of New Site:
- Incomplete text does not work for the search, so if you wanted to search of sightings in a specific month, you would not be able too. In addition to this, if you wanted to search for states or cities that started with the letter "A". You couldn't.
### Recommendations for Further Development:
- Incorporating the fix to the drawback to allow for searches to be incomplete to look for broader search spreads.
- Incorporating a search that isn't case sensitive (however, as you may have noticed I went ahead and did this myself for my own convenience).
- Incorporating a saved list to display multiple cities, states, or shapes. i.e. if you wanted to see all sightings on the east coast you can put all of the east coast states.
