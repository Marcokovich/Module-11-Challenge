## 3. Summary:
### Drawbacks of New Site:
- incomplete text does not work for the search, so if you wanted to search of sightings in a specific month, you would not be able too. In addition to this, if you wanted to search for states or cities that started with the letter "A". You couldn't.
### Recommendations for Further Development:
- incorporating the fix to the drawback to allow for searches to be incomplete to look for broader search spreads.
- incorporating a search that isn't case sensitive (however, as you may have noticed I went ahead and did this myself for my own convenience).
- incorporating a saved list to display multiple cities, states, or shapes. i.e. if you wanted to see all sightings on the east coast you can put all of the east coast states.
